Nasa Apps Challenge 2023 Develop the Oracle of DSCOVR (**D**eep **S**pace **C**limate **O**bser**v**ato**r**y


 ## Challenge:
 - Use the "raw" data from DSCOVR—faults and all— as input to predict geomagnetic storms on Earth. 
 - Create your own geomagnetic activity forecast
 - Train a neural network on DSCOVR data to forecast the Planetary K-index (Kp).

 DSCOVR measures the **strength** and **speed** of the solar wind in space, which enables us to predict **geomagnetic** storms.

 Ariana: I understand that  kp = f(st, sp).  Where st stands for wind strength, sp stands for Speed, and kp stands for Plenetary K-index or strnght of the geomagnetic storm

 DSCOVR, produces occasional faults that may themselves be indicators of space weather.  ????

 ## One possible approach to solve this challenge:
 This challenge is a natural application for an adaptive neural network (ANN) (Machine learning regression)

 ## Sources of data

   This data set has about 9000 Files (one per day each Missio day. Each file has 360 records of 15 fields each.
#### Fields

  - year  
  - day (January 1 = 1) 
  - fraction_of_day  
  - speed (km/s)  
  - E/W_angle (deg) see below 
  - N/S_angle (deg) see below 
  - proton_density (#/cc) 
  - most probable proton_thermal_speed (km/s)  {=sqrt[2kT/Mp] }  
  - alpha_% = 100*(alpha number dens)/(proton number dens) 
       {fill value (-1.e+31) if not available} 
       {This quantity will be added in future analyses.}
  - Vx (km/s)  (velocity component in GSE)
