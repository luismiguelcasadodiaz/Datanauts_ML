 ## Challenge:
 - Use the "raw" data from DSCOVR—faults and all— as input to predict geomagnetic storms on Earth. 
 - Create your own geomagnetic activity forecast
 - Train a neural network on DSCOVR data to forecast the Planetary K-index (Kp).

 DSCOVR measures the **strength** and **speed** of the solar wind in space, which enables us to predict **geomagnetic** storms.

 Ariana: I understand that  kp = f(st, sp).  Where st stands for wind strength, sp stands for Speed, and kp stands for Plenetary K-index or strnght of the geomagnetic storm

 DSCOVR, produces occasional faults that may themselves be indicators of space weather.  ????

 ## One possible approach to solve this challenge:
 This challenge is a natural application for an adaptive neural network (ANN) (Machine learning regression)
